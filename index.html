            <p>When a tornado rips through Kansas, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog, Toto, are whisked away in their
                house to the magical land of Oz. They follow the Yellow Brick Road toward the Emerald City to meet the
                Wizard, and en route they meet a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) that needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley)
                missing a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. The wizard asks the group to bring
                him the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) to earn his help.</p>
